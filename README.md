Performing Exploratory Data  Analysis on Automobile Car Dataset

* The project aims to perform various visualizations and provide various insights from the considered Indian automobile dataset by performing data analysis that    utilizing machine learning algorithms in R programming language. 
* The considered dataset is of Indian cars that consists of various features such as model, manufacturer, year, transmission, engine, power etc.
* The insights that could be estimated from this dataset would be feature such as price of a specific car model that could be estimated using the other attributes of that particular car model using machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression.
